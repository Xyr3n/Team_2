## Project 1 Proposal
#### Proposal Title:
Spotify Trends

#### Team Members:
Richard Bialick, Julio Dela Cruz, Tim Haake, Kylie Li, Nancy Zheng

#### Project Description:
Analyzing current and past data on Spotify (human development index by region/country, genre, artists, podcasts, albums) to identify current trends and predict future trends.

#### Research Questions to Answer:
How have the popularity scores of specific tracks or artists changed over time? What are the current top tracks globally or in a specific region? Who are the most popular artists at the moment? What is the popularity of different types of audio material? What are the emerging trends by region/country What are the emerging trends in music genres?

#### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Each team member will perform individual analysis of data on Spotify (human development index by region/country, genre, artists, podcasts, playlists). Based on each individual's analysis we will make a holistic conclusion of Spotify trends regionally and globally. Each analysis will have:

Request data via Python API and analyze datasets from Spotify
- Matplotlib/Pandas visuals (1-2 each)
- Statistical Analysis
- Update different parts of code via commit and merge branches in Github

### Project Ideas (delete after we decide on a topic):
- Sports Data:
  
https://sportsdata.io/developers/api-documentation/nfl#/sports-data/player-feeds
- E-Commerce
  
- Instagram/Social Media
  
- Spotify Artists:
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
  Research Ideas
  - Spotify API & Billboard Top 100
  - Predict when an artist will "blow-up" in their career. Possible areas to look at: album releases, hit singles, years active 
  an artist/band had an exponential growth or peaked in listeners. We can also have a threshold.
