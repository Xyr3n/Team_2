Steps to use the file to retrieve access token and make a request

1. Make a .env file which stores your client id and client secret. these should be string variables and keep them
in the same directory as your copy of this file

2. make a copy of this file and store it in your own directory. The file here is a .py file and not a .ipny file, which is needed
for jupyter notebook. make sure your .env file is also in this directory.

3. to make a request, simply add your api endpoint and token into spotify(endpoint, token).

4. more to come as we navigate this api!
