## Project 1 Proposal
#### Proposal Title:
Spotify Music Popularity 

#### Team Members:
Richard Bialick, Julio Dela Cruz, Tim Haake, Kylie Li, Nancy Zheng

#### Project Description:
In our project we analyzed different audio features that may contribute to popularity of the top tracks from [the top 10 artists globally in 2023](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-11-29/top-songs-artists-podcasts-albums-trends-2023/) on Spotify. We made conclusions on current and future trends based on comparing various audio features to music popularity.

#### Research Questions to Answer:
How is popularity of popular music affected by audio features such as acousticness, tempo, energy, loudness, speechiness, danceability, and valence?

Using the correlation between popularity and audiofeatures, what can we predict about future music trends?

#### Datasets to Be Used:
Link: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
Documentation>API Endpoints:
- Albums: https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/{id}
- Artists: https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/{id}
- Markets (Country/Region): https://api.spotify.com/v1/markets
- Genres: https://api.spotify.com/v1/recommendations/available-genre-seeds
- Podcast: https://api.spotify.com/v1/shows/{id}

#### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

Each team member will perform individual analysis of data on Spotify (human development index by region/country, genre, artists, podcasts, playlists). Based on each individual's analysis we will make a holistic conclusion of Spotify trends regionally and globally. Each analysis will have:

Request data via Python API and analyze datasets from Spotify
- Matplotlib/Pandas visuals (1-2 each)
- Statistical Analysis
- Update different parts of code via commit and merge branches in Github

Dependent Variable (y): Popularity
Ricky Bialick: Data Extraction & base code & liveness
Julio Dela Cruz: Danceablity & Energy
Tim Haake: Base Code, Clean, Merge
Kylie Li: Valence & Speechiness
Nancy Zheng: Tempo, write-up, proposal, slide deck set-up
